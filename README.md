# PythonBounce

Sample code to bounce a ball around the screen using pygame.

Needed to convert everything to floating point and modify the change in
position code a bit in order to make the ball move properly.

Also included virtual environment support. Use Thaw.cmd to set up the
environment and freezze.cmd to save the environment setup to
requirements.txt for pushing into git.
